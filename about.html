                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                
                <p>I began exploring web development because I enjoy turning ideas into visible, usable products.
                     I started with HTML and CSS, then picked up JavaScript to make interfaces interactive. 
                     Along the way I built small projects, read documentation daily, 
                     and learned to debug by reproducing problems and breaking features on purpose — that taught me more than any tutorial.
                </p>

                <p>Today I focus on creating clean, accessible user interfaces and learning best practices for maintainable code. 
                    I value clarity, incremental improvement, and shipping things people can actually use.
                </p>

                <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
                <p>My goals while working through this program are practical and growth-oriented:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ship at least three complete projects that demonstrate responsive design and accessibility.</li>
                    <li>Deepen my JavaScript knowledge — especially asynchronous patterns and modern tooling.</li>
                    <li>Learn how to test front-end code and set up CI for simple deployments.</li>
                    <li>Improve my ability to read and contribute to open source repositories.</li>
                    <li>Practice clear README and documentation habits so others can use my work.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Areas I'm Improving</h2>

                <p>I am confident with layout and building UIs, but there are areas I want to strengthen:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Back-end integration:</strong> designing stable APIs and handling authentication flows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance tuning:</strong> identifying render bottlenecks and optimizing delivery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> writing reliable unit and integration tests for UI logic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced algorithms:</strong> algorithmic problem solving for interviews and complex features.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are active learning targets — I set small, measurable milestones and iterate from there.</p>

                <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>

                <p>Keep building. Celebrate the small wins and keep a habit of shipping things—even imperfectly. 
                    Revisit old projects and refactor them with what you learn. 
                    Keep your curiosity alive: ask questions, read code, and mentor others when you can.
                </p>

                <p>Remember to document decisions, back up important demos, and keep improving your process. 
                    In a year, compare notes — you’ll be surprised by how much you’ve grown.
                </p>
